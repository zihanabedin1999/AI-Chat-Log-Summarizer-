Task: AI Chat Log Summarizer 
Project Description: 
AI Chat Log Summarizer is a Python-based tool that reads .txt chat logs between 
a user and an AI, parses the conversation, and produces a simple summary 
including message counts and frequently used keywords. 
This project showcases basic NLP capabilities using Python, with an optional 
TF-IDF-based keyword extraction. 
Requirements: 
1. 
2. 
Input: 
1.1. A .txt file that contains a chat between a user and an AI, formatted like 
this: 
User: Hi, can you tell me about Python? 
AI: Sure! Python is a popular programming language known for 
its readability. 
User: What can I use it for? 
AI: You can use Python for web development, data analysis, 
AI, and more. 
What your script should do: 
2.1. Chat Log Parsing 
■ Separate messages by speaker (User: and AI:). 
■ Store messages in appropriate structures for further analysis. 
2.2. 
Message Statistics 
■ Count total messages. 
■ Count messages from User vs. AI.

Keyword Analysis 
■ Extract the top 5 most frequently used words. 
■ Exclude common stop words (e.g., "the", "is", "and"). 
Generate Summary 
Output a clear summary that includes: 
■ Total number of exchanges. 
■ Nature of the conversation (based on keyword topics). 
■ Most common keywords. 
■ Example of a basic summary like: 
Summary: - The conversation had 15 exchanges. - The user asked mainly about Python and its uses. - Most common keywords: Python, use, data, AI, language. 
Bonus (Optional): 
3.1. 
Use a simple TF-IDF approach or nltk library for better keyword 
extraction. 
3.2. 
Allow summarization of multiple chat logs from a folder. 
Sample Chat Log: chat.txt 
User: Hello! 
AI: Hi! How can I assist you today? 
User: Can you explain what machine learning is? 
AI: Certainly! Machine learning is a field of AI that allows systems to 
learn from data.
